It is a georgian used car price dataset. I took this data set from kaggle. This data set has 19237 rows and 18 columns.

Our goal is to predict the price of the car based on the features of the car. We will use machine learning to predict the price of the car.

On seeing the data, we can see that the data is not clean. We have to clean the data first.

We have to find the best model for our car price prediction. Our aim to get R2 score of 0.75 or more and MAE less than 5000.

We will use Linear Regression, Support Vector Regressor, Decision tree, Random forest, and Xgboost. 

We will fine tune our best models among them and get the final model.
